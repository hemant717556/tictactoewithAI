# tictactoewithAI

This application implements the board game TicTacToe for 3 players with modifications to the classic 3x3 board.
This application provides the users with the flexibility of deciding the size of the board and selects the player turns randomly instead of going in a particular order and the player's turn is randomized.

## Dependency
- Python3
- Numpy
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib



## How to Run

- First, Install the python modules which are specified above.
- Download the zipped folder
- Go to the directory
- Run python final.py
- It will ask you if you want to play(Yes or No)
- Then you will have to enter a board size.And size should be between 4 to 8.
- Then it will ask "What the player1, player2 and player3 should be??"

  Options:

  1.Human 	 2.Baseline AI 	 3.TreeBased AI 	 4.Treebased+ NN AI
  Enter your choice of options having a space in between(e.g. 1 2 3)
  
  1 2 3 means player1-Human player2-BaselineAi player3-TreeBased AI
  
- Enter 4 (i.e. Treebased + NN just for player 3).Our code is trained for player 3

- For user,You need to give indexes in "What position do you want to place?(please enter valid position with a space in between)" like 1 3

- For Baseline AI,a random place will be choosen.

- After Tree based AI and Tree based + NN,Please press Enter to go to next step

- After the game ends,It will again ask if you want to play again.
